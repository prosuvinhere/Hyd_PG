* They provide an induction stove, vessels, salt, and a fridge for your use.
* There's an open space in front, as seen on Google Maps.

Cons:
* Only one bathroom and

It is a Co-living PG consisting of 5 floors. One floor has rooms for senior citizens & couples, one floor has rooms for girls & women whereas other floors have rooms for boys & men.

Address:
Plot No 291, Aruna Nilayam ,Uppal Bhagayat, HMDA Layout Rd, Uppal, Hyderabad, Telangana 500039 .

Landmarks:
Nearby there is a 'Cricket net'. 'Nagole Metro Station' the first point of blue line is visible from two faces of premises and till Metro Station it is a 5-10 minutes walk. There is a small bus pickup point adjacent to Metro station just opposite to 'SVM Grand Hotel' on the service road side. 'DSL Virtue Mall' & 'DSL Workplace' is in Uppal. 'Uppal International Cricket Stadium' is also nearby. Near 'Uppal Arch' roads meet in + shape and here buses also stop (one can see the arch from the big skywalk starting from 'Uppal Metro Station'. One 'Gated Community', One 'KV School' and few government offices are also there in Uppal. 'Secunderabad Junction' can be reached after de-boarding in 'Hyderabad East Metro Station' and walking till some distance i.e. 5 minute walk after getting down near bus depo from metro premises. There is also originals of 'Blue Moon Hotel', 'Alpha Hotel' and 'Naturals Ice-Cream' in Secunderabad. Original 'Paradise Biryani' outlet is present which is somewhat near to the 'Paradise Metro Station'. 'JBS' has a big bus stand.
Metro Map-
Below is the metro map for reference purposes.

Public Transport:
There are autos, bus pickup and dropoff points, metro stations and a main train station nearby. If one has to go to inside from the main road then there wouldn't be public transport. As compared to the public transport system in western parts like Pantancheruvu, Kondapur, Manikonda, etc and some southern parts of Hyderabad, it is much better.

Drainage & Stormwater System:
There is no such flooding problems because where this stay is located the roads get cleared of rainwater quickly.

Street Lights:
During night time if one has to walk till Metro Station, the roads leading to them can be dark with some danger from mainly dogs. Would suggest not to walk on these roads during night time for safety reasons.

Parking:
Parking can be done on the ground floor incase one has any vehicle. There is space for parking both four wheeler and two wheeler but there surely isn't a huge space or dedicated space for parking purpose.

Main Flat layout:
One common hall, one common bathroom & toilet along with one common kitchen is their for a series of main flats and the main flat is broken into two individual rooms in these main flats. 
Other main flats don't have two individual rooms.

Room Amenities:
It has chair, shelves, attached bathroom & toilet, work desk, Geyser, AC.

{
Charges & Bills:
- Rent Charges:
1 sharing -> ₹ 13,500
2 sharing -> ₹ 10,000
3 sharing -> ₹ 7,000
4 sharing -> No

- Food type & Food charges:
Food variations-
On most of days South Indian food is cooked and on some days North Indian food is cooked. On Sunday there's non-veg cooked whereas there is an availability of certain fruits and salads on some days. Extra fee has to be paid for food. On some days cook might not come which is informed beforehand in the group. The food is served in basement.
Food fee charges-
There are package options which include the number of days of food service one wants to avail and how many times in a day for the number of days combination selected one wants to avail this service. The price can vary from ₹2000 to ₹3500.

- Electricity Bill:
Based on number of units used and the corresponding cost, the bill may be cleared by management or may be asked to be charged to the tenant. (If low on budget or with a fixed budget, one might have to use AC, Geyser, etc like heavy power consuming appliances judiciously).
Wi-Fi Speed:
For each flat a Wi-Fi router is provided and there are many minimal Wi-Fi problems.

- Maintenance Charges:
No separate charges of this kind. Cleaning of common areas alongside tenant rooms is done and collection of garbage is done on 6 out of 7 days by staff assigned by the management.

- Security Deposit:
A ₹5000 security deposit payment has to be done at the time of enrolling for room accommodation. Minimum of 2 weeks before leaving, a notice has to be given to both the caretaker and owner. Based on when the tenant gave leave notice and after inspection of the condition of room which one stayed in, the security deposit amount might be adjusted and returned back.
}

Staff & Contact:
The name of the caretaker person is Mr. Arune (+91 9542365971). The name of the owner is Mr. Vijay (+91 8008701863). The website is https://theneststay.in/. There's a WhatsApp group as well where the updates related to any events/issues are given. In case facing any problem/problems and want to get it/them resolved, have to lodge complaint in an app (fields include explaining all the details regarding the problem and selecting a day and timing based on your availability for smooth resolution of the issue); the other alternative is you also let the caretaker know that a complaint was raised so that he can contact the technicians, etc directly. 

Security:
CCTV was present from the starting in ground floor, recently though CCTV cameras were installed on all floors. Don't expect 100% guarded personnel, the PG caretaker sometimes stays in ground floor to check for anyone entering but it's not a guarantee as he may go out or stay in his room the other times. There are other temporary staff as well who come in to premises and perform the caretaker's tasks when the caretaker is out of premises for long duration of time.

Amenities:
Other than three 'Washing Machines' and 'Cloth hanging threads' on terrace which come under minor amenities, there aren't any major amenities as of my knowledge at the time of leaving.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[
Verdict: (4/5)
It's good and didn't face too many problems while residing here. When facing problems and brought to their notice, they resolved it quickly. Everything happened in an organised and timely manner when staying there. No major complaints as of such.

It is authentic and good. The owner is an army retired personnel so he knows how to provide service to people. He does good job in maintaining things here. The rooms are good. The ones facing towards the road is quite good in terms of airflow while the ones facing towards the building on the opposite road might feel congested. The rooms in 1st &2nd floors have few insects roaming around (in few rooms only) but the top floors are good. The internet works well.

WiFi Speed- enough for my needs(downloading movies, games etc), but in case you play games like valorant(where ping matters) ping is shit ( hathway connection maybe thats why) 
Security - cctv cams are there
no gym
no gamezone/game place
owner is a micromanager, for eg he is telling us to use washing machine in 30mins mode only(quick wash) and we are not supposed to use other normal modes like cotton etc,etc, but people still keep using
parking is a hassle, the owner keeps telling everyone to not keep handle locks on vehicles
lift keeps getting stuck and stops working, and at nights they will turn off the lift so if you are in 4/5th floor and u come back at say 12night, they u have to climb stairs

so overall for me food is good, the pg is kept clean nicely, the other things i just try to ignore coz for me food, hygiene were priority

Food - I liked a lot
Gym - yes ( you can look it on g maps images)
Special events - Every month one night Food fest be conducted.
Public transport- I think 0.5 km there will be bus stop. Near by Zudio and Star mart also avilable.
The above rent is for AC 3 share ( 3 months back)

Cons: 
One thing I didn't expect is bed bugs suddenly came from nowhere and messed it up in my last month of stay . However they have sprayed some pesticides or sprays to solve the issue but it took 2-3 weeks for them to resolve the issue.  And I'm not sure whether it  worked or not. And this is not with all rooms only in some rooms.

Apart from that everything is amazing.
